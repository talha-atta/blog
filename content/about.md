Currently I'm in explore mode (working on projects and learning skills), actively looking for my next [long term opportunity](https://blog.samaltman.com/advice-for-ambitious-19-year-olds), if you're starting something new or know of an exciting project I would love to hear about it.

I live in Toronto. In the past I joined The Tech Society (early stage events startup) as the second employee and helped scale the team to 15+ people. I'm also a [TKS Alumni](https://tks.world).

**Interests:**

- Human & life optimization
- Startups
- Programming
- [Making good decisions](https://www.lesswrong.com/)
- Biohacking & nootropics
- Learning how to maximize my impact on this planet
