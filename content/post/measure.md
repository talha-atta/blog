I'm really interested in personal optimization and self-improvement. I've learned for myself that the best way to improve something is to measure it.

There are a ton of self-tracking and productivity tools on the market. I've spent a ton of time researching and testing various tools, so I decided to compile a list of some of the best ones I've found.

### Best Wearables & Health Trackers

**[Oura Ring](https://ouraring.com/)**

- I've tried an Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Oura. Oura has by far been the most accurate and actionable.

**[Fitbit Versa 2](https://www.fitbit.com/us/products/smartwatches/versa)**

- If an Oura is too pricey, or you're more interested in tracking general fitness instead of just sleep Fitbit Versa 2 is the next best wearable.

**[Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch)**

- If you're an iPhone user and want to have notfications, Apple Watch is the way to go.

### Best Life Trackers

I haven't found one that I love or one that does tracking right for my needs. Currently I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) with a customized personal set up. Here are some I would recommend checking out:

**[Gyroscope](https://gyrosco.pe/app/)**

- Doesn't require a wearable and is an app. Does a lot of statistical analysis for you and helps you interpret your data. Has a monthly/yearly subscription model.

**[Super](https://gosuper.io/)**

- Free web app, manually choose what you want and log it.

**[Exist](https://exist.io/)**

- Web app that has a monthly/yearly subscription model. Does a lot of interpretation for you, has a ton of integrations for existing data, and you can also manually choose what you want to track.

**[Nomie](https://nomie.app/)**

- Build on blockstack and focused around privacy.

**[Habitica](https://habitica.com/static/home)**

- Both web and mobile app. Has a monthly/yearly subscription model.

### Task Tracking

**[Todoist](https://todoist.com/)**

- Highly recommended to do list manager by many people, and has a good freemium model. I personally don't like it.

**[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)**

- One time fee to buy Mac and iPhone app. This is the To Do List manager I used for many years before switching everything to Notion.

### Computer & Phone Usage Tracker

**[Rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com/dashboard)**

- Really great free version, I've used this for years.

**[iPhone & Macbook Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT208982)**

- These have gotten much better over time and I find myself using the in built Screen Time apps over Rescuetime.

### Food & Diet Tracker

**[MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/)**

- No question that this is the best food tracker on the market.

---

### Time Tracking

**[Toggl](https://toggl.com/)**

- Really great time tracker, if this had a free version I would continue using it. Currently Toggl has a monthly/yearly subscription plan.

**[Rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com/dashboard)**

- Really great free version, I've used this for years.

---

### Media & Book Tracking

**[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)**

- For all Movie/TV tracking

**[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/)**

- For tracking all the books you've read or want to read.

**[Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/)**

- For tracking all the music you listen to.

---

### Period Tracking

**[Clue](https://helloclue.com/)**

- I discovered this while researching life tracking apps, I had no idea period tracking was this big a thing but many girls use Clue.

---

### Sleep Tracking

**[Oura Ring](https://ouraring.com/)**

- If you can afford it I definitely recommend it

**[Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock](https://www.sleepcycle.com/)**

- I use this as my alarm clock because it wakes you up at the lightest part of your sleep cycle instead of a certain time. It also tracks your sleep each night.


_This is an ongoing list that I'll be updating as I discover new applications and tools. If you have any recommendations to add or improvements to make let me know!_
