_An interesting thought I had from following some of the lifestyle/health trends of Silicon Valley and reflecting on my childhood during Ramadan:_

I grew up as muslim and was raised to follow the rules of islam, as much as the religion get’s a lot of hate for the activities of some extremists today. I think there were a lot of valuable habits and lifestyle choices I picked up from being raised to follow the religion.

**Growing up as a muslim I learned:**

- To pray five times a day
- Fast for one month of the year for clarity and restraint
- NO Alcohol because it’s bad for your mental state and health
- To enter a faithful long term relationship for a fulfilling family life and happy family
- To engage in effective altruism by giving “zakat” (charity) to the poor

**From Tech Twitter I learned:**

- To engage in mindfulness multiple times a day, and adopt a practice of meditation
- To intermittent fast, and occasionally fast for multiple days for health
- Not to drink alcohol because it’s a crutch, kills productivity, and social drinking is over rated
- Finding a loving long term partner that will support you through the highs and lows is helpful
- Your goal should be to build a company that will make the world a better place, and along the way to help people less fortunate than you

I’m now asking myself if I'm falling for Silicon Valley hype trends, or if I'm really just becoming a really good modern muslim.
